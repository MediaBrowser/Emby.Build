Comment: Apache-2.0 License with additionnal preamble
 .
 From 1987 to October 1999 (through ImageMagick 4.2.9), ImageMagick
 was developed and distributed by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and
 Company.
 .
 As of 1999, E. I. du Pont de Nemours gave up all rights and
 privileges to the ImageMagick software suite and assigned
 ownership to ImageMagick Studio LLC.
 .
 ImageMagick makes use of third-party "delegate" libraries to support
 certain optional features.  These libraries bear their own copyrights
 and licenses, which may be more or less restrictive than the
 ImageMagick license. For convenience, when ImageMagick is bundled
 with (or compiled with) "delegate" libraries, a copy of the licenses
 for these libraries is provided in a "licenses" directory.

 LEGAL ISSUES
 ============
 .
 In plain English:
 .
 1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
    please let us know!)
 2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
 3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
    program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
    you've used the IJG code.
 .
 In legalese:
 .
 The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
 with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
 fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
 its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
 .
 This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
 All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
 .
 Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
 software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
 conditions:
 (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
 README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
 unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
 must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
 (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
 documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
 the Independent JPEG Group".
 (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
 full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
 NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
 .
 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
 not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
 acknowledge us.
 .
 Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
 in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
 it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
 software".
 .
 We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
 commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
 assumed by the product vendor.
 .
 ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
 sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
 ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
 by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
 that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
 ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
 of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
 the foregoing paragraphs do.
 .
 The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
 It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
 The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
 ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
 by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
 .
 It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
 patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
 legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
 support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
 (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
 Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
 So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
 code.
 .
 The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
 To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
 been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
 "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
 resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
 GIF decoders.
 .
 We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

 Contribution shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
 version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
 Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor
 for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual
 or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright
 owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form
 of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor
 or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on

 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly
 display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and
 such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 .
 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent
 license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
 otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
 patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
 infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
 Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
 submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
 the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
 direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
 the date such litigation is filed.
 .
 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work
 or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet
 the following conditions:
 .
  * You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works
    a copy of this License; and You must cause any modified files to
    carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
  * You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that
    You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
    notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices
    that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
  * If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of
    the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as
    part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
    the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
    modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
    within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an
    addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
    additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying
    the License.
 .
 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
 modifications and may provide additional or different license
 terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of
 Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
 provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work
 otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
 .
 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by
 You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this
 License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding
 the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
 separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
 regarding such Contributions.
 .
 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 .
 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed
 to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor
 provides its Contributions) on an AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
 CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
 limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
 MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
 responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
 redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
 exercise of permissions under this License.
 .
 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless
 required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
 acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You
 for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
 consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
 License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
 not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
 failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
 losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility
 of such damages.
 .
 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and
 charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
 liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on
 Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
 other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and
 hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or
 claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting
 any such warranty or additional liability.
